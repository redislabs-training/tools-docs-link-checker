# Documentation link checker

Checks for broken links on the documentation sites.

1. Change the directory to the subfolder of your site, e.g. `redisio`
2. Ensure that the `check_links.bash` file uses a valid Python environment and that you installed all the requirements that are stated in `requirements.txt`
3. Run the bash script `check_links.bash`
